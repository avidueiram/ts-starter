# Commits

- Never push directly to `develop`, `staging` or `master` branches.
- Never push with the `--force` flag.
- Never commit and push credentials, secrets or sensitive data like API keys, passwords, service accounts, private keys, etc.
- Never commit and push large files, like images, videos, etc.
- Never commit and push generated files, like `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, etc.
- Every commit message should use the following format:

```<type>(scope): <subject>```

Types:

- `feat`: new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
- `fix`: bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
- `docs`: changes to the documentation
- `style`: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change
- `refactor`: refactoring production code, ex. renaming a variable
- `test`: adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
- `chore`: updating grunt tasks etc.; no production code change

Scopes (optional): App, lib, server component name, ex. hogar-app, core, accounts-server

Example:

```text
feat(hogar-app): new footer component added for mobile
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary of the changes

+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test
```
